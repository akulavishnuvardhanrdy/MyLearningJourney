**Question**:  
There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.
You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.  

**Solutions**:   


**Optimal Solution**:  

    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        while(node.next.next!=null){
            node.val = node.next.val;
            node = node.next;
        }
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = null;
    }
