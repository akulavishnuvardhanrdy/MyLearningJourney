**Question**:  
You're given a sorted array 'a' of 'n' integers and an integer 'x'.  
Find the floor and ceiling of 'x' in 'a[0..n-1]'.  

**Solutions**:   


**Optimal Solution**:  

    public static int[] getFloorAndCeil(int[] arr, int n, int x) {
      int ans[] = new int[2];
      int low=0,high=n-1;
      while(low<=high){
        int mid = low+(high-low)/2;
        if(arr[mid]<=x)
          low = mid+1;
        else
          high = mid-1;
      }
      ans[0] = high>=0?arr[high]:-1;

      low=0;
      high=n-1;
      while(low<=high){
        int mid = low+(high-low)/2;
        if(arr[mid]<x)
          low = mid+1;
        else
          high = mid-1;
      }
      ans[1] = low<n?arr[low]:-1;

      return ans;
    }
