**Question**:  
Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, the task is to find the upper bound of the target in this given array.  

**Solutions**:   


**Optimal Solution**:  
1.Using Binary Search just add some simple logic  
2.if arr[mid] greater x take ans as mid and proccced the binary search..

    int upperBound(int[] arr, int target) {
        int low = 0,high = arr.length-1;
        int ans = arr.length;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid = low+(high-low)/2;
            if(arr[mid]>target){
                ans = mid;
                high = mid-1;
            }
            else{
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
