**Question**:  
Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to x. This element is called the floor of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.  

**Solutions**:   


**Optimal Solution**:  
1.Using Binary Search just add some simple logic  
2.if arr[mid] less than x take ans as mid and proccced the binary search.. 

    static int findFloor(int[] arr, int x) {
        // write code here
        int low = 0, high = arr.length-1;
        int ans = -1;
        while(low<=high){
            int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
            if(arr[mid]<=x) {
                ans = mid;
                low=mid+1;
            }
            else
                high=mid-1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
